# Spec-Kit CLI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
The Specification is the single source of truth. Code is a derived artifact. The flow of change is strictly unidirectional: Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Code. Implementation never precedes specification.

### II. Pure CLI Architecture
The system is designed exclusively as a Command-Line Interface.
- Input via arguments, flags, and stdin.
- Output via stdout (data) and stderr (logs/errors).
- No TUI (Text User Interface) libraries or GUI elements unless explicitly specified for a specific visual feature.
- Design for composability (unix pipes).

### III. In-Memory Persistence
For Phase I, all data persistence is ephemeral and in-memory.
- No database connections (SQLite, Postgres, etc.).
- No file-based storage for domain entities (JSON/CSV dumps).
- State exists only during the process lifecycle.

### IV. Clean Code & Modern Python
Implementation must utilize Python 3.13+ features and Clean Code standards.
- Rigid adherence to PEP 8.
- Comprehensive Type Hinting (mypy strict).
- Descriptive naming conventions.
- Small, single-responsibility functions and classes.

### V. Agent-Exclusive Implementation
The Human defines the "What" (Spec/Review); the Agent implements the "How" (Code/Test).
- Manual code editing is forbidden except for trivial configuration or debugging.
- All production code is generated by the Agent tools.

### VI. Test-First Rigor
No logic is written without a failing test (Red-Green-Refactor).
- Unit tests for all business logic.
- Integration tests for CLI commands.
- 100% pass rate required for "Done".

## Technical Constraints

- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Environment**: Linux (WSL 2)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies; prefer Standard Library.
- **Project Structure**: src/ layout, distinct separation of interface (CLI) and core logic.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Clarify**: User defines goals.
2.  **Spec**: Agent drafts detailed requirements (`/sp.specify`).
3.  **Plan**: Agent architects the solution (`/sp.plan`).
4.  **Task**: Agent breaks down work (`/sp.tasks`).
5.  **Implement**: Agent writes tests and code (`/sp.implement` / tools).
6.  **Verify**: Automated test suites + User acceptance.

## Governance

This Constitution serves as the primary governance document for the Spec-Kit CLI project.
- **Amendments**: Changes to principles require a Pull Request and explicit user approval.
- **Supremacy**: In conflicts between code and constitution, the constitution prevails.
- **Definition of Done**: A feature is Done when it is Specified, Tested, Implemented, Verified, and Documented.
